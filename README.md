<h1>Useful Unity Scripts</h1>
</br>
An assortments of modular scripts that can be chained together or used independently to accomplish a verity of basic and complex tasks. 
</br>
I will often use these scripts at the start of a new project to easily create certain prefabs. They mainly work though unity events calling public methods. This is very helpful as they are easy understand and to put together into something more complex, like building blocks.

<h2>Effects</h2>
A collection of scripts that will preform an effect such as a popup, text scroll or flash.

</br></br>
Destructible: This script spawns a destroyed gameobject and removes the gameobject it is attached to.

</br></br>
PopdownEffect: Perform the popdown effect on a gameobject.
</br></br>
PopupEffect: Perform popup effect on a gameobject. Gameobject will be scaled from a small size to a larger size then back down to its original size.
</br></br>
SpawnPrefab: Spawn a prefab at a given transfrom.
</br></br>
TextMeshProScrollEffect: Take a string of textmesh. Reveal one character at a time based on the 'charRevealRate' variable. Unreveal the text based on the same variable.

</br></br>
IDEventEmitter: Send out delegate with ID variable and gameobject.
</br></br>

</br></br>
